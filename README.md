# Ekagon

A nice cool Amazon like Ecommerce website.


## Listings Page: 

Displays all available listings to buy. Clicking on a listing will take you to the Listing Page

## Listing Page:

### Available

It shows price and other information about the listing and gives you an option to buy the product.

### Unavailable

It shows the listing and details but it looks grey so people know it is sold out and says in red “BOUGHT”. There is no buy button.

## Buy Page:

It asks for information about where you live and credit card information (fake). And a checkout button. It makes the product unavailable.
